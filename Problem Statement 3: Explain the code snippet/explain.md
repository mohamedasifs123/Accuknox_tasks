# Explaining how the highlighted constructs work?

## Channel Initialization: make(chan func(), 10)

make(chan func(), 10): This line creates a buffered channel named cnp that can hold up to 10 elements of type func(). It's used to send functions (func()) to goroutines for execution.
  Goroutines Creation: for i := 0; i < 4; i++ { go func() {...} }


## Goroutines Creation: for i := 0; i < 4; i++ { go func() {...} }
This loop creates 4 goroutines concurrently. Each goroutine executes the anonymous function defined inside go func() { ... }().
The function starts an infinite loop (for f := range cnp) that listens on channel cnp for incoming functions (func()). When a function is received (f()), it executes it.
Sending a Function to Channel: cnp <- func() { fmt.Println("HERE1") }

## Sending a Function to Channel: cnp <- func() { fmt.Println("HERE1") }
This line sends an anonymous function to the channel cnp.
The function sent (func() { fmt.Println("HERE1") }) simply prints "HERE1" when executed.

## Main Function Print: fmt.Println("Hello")
This line prints "Hello" from the main function

# Use Cases:

Concurrency Patterns: This pattern is used in Go to achieve concurrent execution of tasks where tasks can be dynamically dispatched to goroutines using channels.

Asynchronous Processing: Buffered channels allow decoupling of producers and consumers, enabling efficient asynchronous processing of tasks.

# Significance of the For Loop with 4 Iterations:

The loop for i := 0; i < 4; i++ spawns 4 goroutines, each of which listens indefinitely (for f := range cnp) for functions sent to the cnp channel. This concurrent setup allows for parallel processing of functions sent to cnp.

# Significance of make(chan func(), 10):

make(chan func(), 10) creates a buffered channel capable of holding 10 functions (func()). This buffering ensures that sends (cnp <- func() {...}) can happen without blocking until the channel is full.
# Why "HERE1" is not getting printed:

In this code, "HERE1" is not printed because the main program terminates after sending the function to the cnp channel (cnp <- func() {...}) and printing "Hello". The goroutines spawned in the for loop are not synchronized with the main program's execution. By the time the goroutines start executing (for f := range cnp { ... }), the main program has already exited, leading to an immediate termination of the program without allowing the goroutines to process the function sent to cnp.
